## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned a lot in this project. The main part is how to create a toggler for changing the theme of the page. It took two days to learn stuff and create it. I got final end product but in the process I learned a lot of stuff. The js part was easy though I got help from stackOverflow . But designing that toggler took lot of efforts. I learned about CSS variables in this project. Previously I don't know about that. The calculator part of js took some time. Web dev Simplified's calc logic was the one I followed. I am gradually improving in understanding js. In future possibly I could do js parts without a lot of help.
